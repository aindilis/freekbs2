tools



In recent years the number of computational tools useful for modal logics, and
related logics, has increased significantly, and is continuously increasing.
The following is an incomplete list of

  • Accessible theorem provers
  • Translators
  • Automated correspondence theory
  • Visualisation
  • Generators of formulae
  • Collections of problems
  • Related links

Accessible theorem provers

  • Aximo - a tool for verifying knowledge in dynamic multi-agent scenarios
    based on the algebraic axiomatics of dynamic epistemic logic. Implemented
    by Simon Richards and Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh.
  • BLIKSEM - Hans de Nivelle's resolution based theorem prover for modal logic
    and first-order logic with equality.
  • DLP - An experimental tableaux-based inference system by Peter
    Patel-Schneider for a range of description logics.
  • FaCT++ - A tableaux-based description logic OWL reasoner by Ian Horrocks
    and Dmitry Tsarkov. Successor of FaCT.
  • Gost - A Lisp implementation of a tableau algorithm for GF1-, a sublogic of
    the "First Guarded Fragment".
  • Herod and Pilate - Two tableau decision procedures for the hybrid logic HL
    (@) implemented by Marta Cialdea, Serenella Cerrito and their students.
    Based on internalized tableau calculi, without loop-checking and no
    restriction on the order of the application of the rules.
  • J-prover - A connection/matrix based prover that produces sequent proofs
    for FO-Intuitionistic, and propositional S4 and S4nJ logics, implemented as
    a module of the MetaPRL logical framework. Web interface for modal logic.
  • KtSeqC - A theorem prover for the minimal tense logic Kt.
  • LoTREC - A generic tableau theorem prover for modal logic, which is
    suitable for creating, testing and analysing tableau method
    implementations. Web interface
  • Logics Workbench (LWB) - A sequent based theorem prover for a range of
    propositional logics, including modal logics, temporal logics,
    intuitionistic logics and nonmonotonic logics. Web interface
  • MetTeL - a general tableau prover core allowing specifications of several,
    different tableau provers in a plug-in style. Implemented by Dmitry
    Tishkovsky.
  • MLTP - An efficient and generic modal logic tableau prover inplemented by
    Zhen Li.
  • ModLeanTAP - A lean implementation of a free variable tableau calculus for
    a range of propositional modal logics.
  • Molle - A cross-platform prover written in Java that implements Fitting's
    1969 semantic tableaux algorithm for propositional modal logic. It can
    prove the validity of modal formulae and generate (counter-)models.
  • MSPASS - An enhancement of the first-order theorem prover SPASS with a
    translator of modal formulae and formulae of the relational calculus into
    first-order logic with equality. The features of MSPASS are now
    incorporated in the latest release of SPASS. Web interface
  • pdl-tableau - A prototypical implementation of the tableau calculus for
    PDL. Implemented by Renate Schmidt. Web interface
  • ptl - A propositional temporal logic (PTL) tautology checker developed by
    Geert Janssen at Eindhoven University of Technology. (28/03/2005: It seems
    that this tool is no longer available on-line.) Web interface
  • pttf - A satisfiability checker for propositional temporal transition
    formulae developed by Anatol Ursu. Web interface
  • RACER - A description logic reasoner for the Semantic Web languages OWL/
    RDF.
  • Saga - A Lisp program implementing a tableau algorithm for the Guarded
    Fragment of Predicate Logic.
  • Saturate - An experimental theorem prover for first-order logic, primarily
    based on saturation. It includes a translator for modal logic into
    first-order logic by semantic embedding.
  • SPASS - A saturation-based resolution theorem prover for first-order logic
    with equality, sorted logic, and many non-classical logics including
    traditional style modal logics, dynamic modal logics, description logics
    and relational logics.
  • *SAT - An experimentation platform of SAT-based decision procedures for
    expressive description logics, modal and temporal logics.
  • STeP - The Stanford Temporal Prover, combines deductive methods with
    algorithmic techniques to verify linear-time temporal logic specifications
    of reactive and real-time systems.
  • TRP - A protoypical implementation of a theorem prover for propositional
    linear-time logic based on the temporal resolution calculus.
  • TRP++ - A C++ implementation of a theorem prover for propositional
    linear-time logic based on the temporal resolution calculus.
  • TeMP - A C++ implementation of a theorem prover for the monodic fragment of
    first-order linear-time temporal logic over expanding domains based on the
    temporal resolution calculus.
  • Tableau WorkBench (TWB) - A generic framework for building automated
    theorem provers for arbitrary propositional logics, includig modal and
    temportal logics.

Translators

  • SPASS, MSPASS - Can be used as a translator of modal formulae, formulae of
    description logics, and formulae of the relational calculus into
    first-order logic with equality. Various standard and non-standard
    translations are available. MSPASS Web interface
  • Axiomatic translation - An implementation of the axiomatic translation for
    a large class of modal axioms by John Kevin Smith. Web interface
  • PLTLmona - A translator from propositional linear-time logic to MONA input
    syntax.
  • Small collection of useful code - including SICStus Prolog code for the
    functional translation of modal formulae, SICStus Prolog code for
    simplifying modal formulae. Written for an empirical analysis of decision
    procedures for modal logic.

Automated correspondence theory

These tools are useful for computing correspondence properties:

  • The DLS Algorithm - A general tool for the elimination of second-order
    quantifiers, based on Ackermann's Lemma. Web interface - Example, for axiom
    schema T:
    exists P (-( all x (P(x) -> (exists y (R(x,y) & P(y))))))
  • SCAN - A general tool for the elimination of second-order quantifiers,
    based on resolution. Accepts also modal syntax. Web interface
  • SQEMA - Computes first-order equivalents and proves canonicity of modal
    formulas. Web interface

Visualisation

  • Logic Animations - A collection of JavaScript programs used for teaching of
    basic mathematical logic.

Generators of formulae

  • LISP code for randomly generating CNF formulae of multi-modal K -
    implemented by Ullrich Hustadt.
  • Generators are distributed together with some provers, e.g. FaCT and DLP.
  • TANCS Benchmarks Generators - implemented in C by Fabio Massacci and
    Francesco Donini. See also TANCS.

Collections of problems

The collection of modal problem sets is beginning to grow rapidly. The webpages
of some provers above also have links to benchmark collections.

  • LWB benchmark formulae - for the propositional modal logics K, KT, and S4.
  • TANCS Problems - TANCS is a Non Classical System Comparison held regularly
    in conjunction with the TABLEAUX Conferences.
  • Multi-agent modelling in the Logics Workbench - A small number of
    implementations of situations, problems and reasoning in multi-agent
    systems, using epistemic logics.

Also of interest: Benchmark formulae for intuitionistic propositional logic.
