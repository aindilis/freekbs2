The SZS Problem Status Ontology
-------------------------------

The output from current ATP systems varies widely in quantity, quality, and
meaning.  At the low end of the scale, systems that search for a refutation of
a set of clauses may output only an assurance that a refutation exists (the
wonderful "yes" output). At the high end of the scale a system may output a
natural deduction proof of a problem expressed in FOF. In some cases the
output is misleading, e.g., when a CNF based system claims that a FOF input
problem is "unsatisfiable" it typically means that the negated CNF of the
problem is unsatisfiable.

In order to use ATP systems' results, e.g., as input to other tools, it is
necessary that the ATP systems correctly and precisely specify what has been
established. To this end the SZS problem status ontology has been established.
The ontology was based on initial work done to establish communication
protocols for systems on the MathWeb Software Bus. The ontology is shown
below.

The ontology assumes that the input F is of the form Ax => C, where Ax is a
set (conjunction) of axioms and C is a single conjecture formula. This is a
common standard usage of ATP systems.
+ The status value indicates the relationship between Ax and C.
+ By showing that F is valid, an ATP system shows that C is a theorem (a
  logical consequence) of Ax, i.e., Ax |= C, where |= is the standard first
  order entailment.
+ If F is not valid, there are several other possible relationships between Ax
  and C, as shown in the ontology.

If F is not of the form Ax => C, it is treated as a single monolithic
conjecture formula (even if it is an "axiom" or "set of axioms" from the user
view point). This is equivalent to Ax being TRUE. In this case not all of the
statuses are appropriate, and those that are possible are marked with a * in
the ontology.
+ Systems that report Theorem for a monolithic formula must have established
  Tautology.
+ A set of axioms is treated as a conjecture formed from the conjunction of the
  formulae.
+ This is the scenario for a set of clauses.
