This is a tutorial of how to use the freekbs2 emacs software.

Suppose you have the following assertions, in Emacs Format, in your
buffer, and you wished to convert them to a Perl format.

("has-postal-address" ("contact-fn" 1135) ("address-fn" "200 South Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60606"))
("has-location"
 ("address-fn" "200 South Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60606")
 ("lat-long-fn" ("latitude-fn" "41.880537") ("longitude-fn" "-87.637038")))

# need to show how to run this on the input # kbs2 --input-type "Emacs String" --output-type "Interlingua" convert test.kbs
